# Visual_Interfaces_Project_1

## Motivation
In this project I want to help a general audience understand socio-economic data points about US counties. The theme for my project is "Exploring economy and how they impact military service and verterans". I wanted to do this project because I am related to many veterans and I wanted to understand how their service has impacted their lives and the lives of those around them. I also wanted to understand how the economy of the area they live in has impacted their lives and if it impacted their decision to join the military.

This project is important because it helps us understand the impact of the economy on the lives of veterans and how it impacts their decision to join the military. It also helps us understand how the economy of the area they live in impacts their lives and the lives of those around them. This project can help us understand the socio-economic factors that impact the lives of veterans and how we can help them.

## Data
The data I used for this project is from the USDA atlas of rural and small-town America. The data includes socio-economic data points about US counties. The data includes information about the economy, population, and military service of US counties. For my project, I used data about the economy and military service of US counties. I preprocessed the data by removing all data points that were not relevant to my project. I also made a "magic number" row (value -1) so that I could include descriptions of the data points in my visualization.
Links for the original data and my preprocessed data are below:

## Challenges and Future Work

## AI and Collaboration
- I use github copilot when I program. This is used more as an autocomplete tool than anything.
- I used google to learn how to do the cloropleth map. I lost the link though. The code is mostly my own though.
